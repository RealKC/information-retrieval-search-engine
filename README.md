## Information retrieval labwork and project

This repository contains my labwork and project for my Information retrieval course, structured in the following way:

- `scripts/` - miscellaneous scripts
- `packages/` - shared libraries used in implementing labs and project components
- `Labs/` - my solutions to each week's lab exercises
- `Proiect/` - a web search engine with a Flask frontend
